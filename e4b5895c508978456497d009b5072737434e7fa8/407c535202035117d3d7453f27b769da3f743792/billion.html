<ol>
<li>Go onto the roof of the billion</li>

<li>When the trap door opens get a ladder and hook it onto the edge of the roof</li>
<li>Climb down the ladder and sit on the bottom rung</li>
<li>Put your phone on the ground with the Twyford Official app open</li>
<li>Lift up the phone and three words should appear on the ground where it was</li>
